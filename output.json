Fourth, regulatory easing is also underway, with the RBI reversing the November 2023 hike in risk weights for bank loans to NBFCs and microfinance consumer credit loans. Looking ahead, we expect key shifts in market trends: • Growth leadership is shifting from government capital expenditures to consumer discretionary spending. • After an outperformance of around three years, Value may take a back seat, and Quality and growth factors may regain favour. Looking ahead, discretionary consumption is expected to rise, driven by budget stimulus for the urban middle class, followed by a pay commission-related boost next year. Additionally, liquidity easing, accompanied by rate cuts, would create a favourable premise for growth and quality to come back. • In our portfolios, we have been shifting some weight from Value to quality and growth over the last year."

We think market has already priced in two rate cuts both in bonds and OIS markets, also spreads compressed between the G-sec and corporate bonds as investors subscribed for better accrual specially in the short-medium term yield curve i.e. 2–5-year maturity. The narrowing spread between the US treasury and India’s G-secs (at 165 bps it has narrowed by roughly three-quarters) may act as a deterrent for the yields to soften further significantly further add complexity of Japan rising yield and inflation. It is important to disentangle whether the narrowing gap is primarily due to India’s improving macroeconomic fundamentals or external developments like US monetary policy shifts. In truth, it is a combination of both. Outlook: Softening global commodity prices, above- normal rainfall expectations and probable improvement in agricultural output helping headline inflation remain benign. Combined with expectations of decline in the U.S. dollar index and anticipated rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve create further room for monetary easing in India leading to further decline in domestic yields in the coming months. We expect the Indian benchmark 10-year bond yield to trade in the 6.10-6.30% range taking into consideration scope for a deeper rate cut cycle and continued easy liquidity."
